Instructions
------------
bacteria.py is the main file for this project. The following will
execute the file with the default behavior. The p flag tells bacteria which
directory to look for flat frames and image data. Any .raw image beginning with
"bact" is read in as a data image, and any .raw beginning with "flat" is read
in as a flat frame.

    python bacteria.py -p <image_dir>
